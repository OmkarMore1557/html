        <p>Neurons, also known as nerve cells, are essentially the cells that make up the brain and the nervous system.
             Neurons do not touch each other, but where one neuron comes close to another neuron, a synapse is formed between the two.
            According to research, the human brain contains around 86 billion neurons (Herculano-Houzel, 2009).
             These cells develop fully around the time of birth but, unlike other cells, cannot reproduce or regenerate once they die.</p>
